- 👋 Hi, I’m @mintymalty
- 👀 I’m interested in lots of nerdy stuff, like PC parts, benchmark tests, videogame development, monitors, and keybaords!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning basic IT, though I hope to learn Security + and coding like C++ and Jave soon!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing yet.. I have nothing of worth to offer other than management and ideas 🤷‍♂️
- 📫 How to reach me: discord! Maybe!
- 😄 Pronouns: Any! Though I use he/him as I'm just your average guy, I don't really *mind either way*
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have a very hard time coming up with fun facts about me!
